# TaskBoard
TaskBoard or Challenge 5 consists of implementing my new skills with third party APIs to create a Task Board.  It demonstrates the use of jQuery and JavaScript Bootstrap. This challenge also reinforces aspects of HTML and functions in JavaScript.

## Features
Notes:  There are notes throughout the code I used to help label and understand what was done.

Clean Code: Most of the HTML code was already provided.  I tried to continue using clean and clear HTML code when creating my Modal.  I also made sure my JavaScript code was done in a clear and organized way.

User Friendly: The code I created should make the user experience very friendly.  This includes filling out the Task form, moving the task to whichever column they think is necessary for said task, make deleting the tasks easy, and ensure all tasks are saved that the user wants saved.

Collaberation: I have given credit to those who assisted me with this project.  Their assistance ranges for guiding me in the right direction when doing document research for the correct code to helping me debug my code.

    I used this AI to confirm the information I was given by the learning assistant. I also used it to ask questions if I was still not able to understand what SXpert Learning Assistant was telling me.
